This repository includes the code for a Netlogo model associated with:

Shelby M. Scott, Erin N. Bodine & Anne Yust (2014) An Agent-Based Model of Santa Cruz Island Foxes (Urocyon littoralis santacruzae) which Exhibits an Allee Effect, Letters in Biomathematics, 1:1, 97-109, DOI: 10.1080/23737867.2014.11414473.

The code models the behavior of the Santa Cruz island fox under the effects of an allele that alters the reproductive success of mated fox pairs. We use this model to explore the possible factors which led to the population decline of the island fox in the early 1990s. It is a fairly simple agent-based model with few parameters that can be altered by users, but is powerful in that changes to the parameters will cause tangible differences in the population dynamics.
